### Wiggle

Have you ever wanted to create a long wave of text like this : 

![An image of text printed in a wave pattern.](images/default.png)

This project is intended to satisfy that wish. 

Clone a copy of the repository to your system with : 
```git clone https://github.com/AS-Nath/wiggle```

The user is expected to modify the source to select the parameters of the wiggle text they would like (word, number of waves, length of wave). They can recompile the source and run accordingly.

Should the user wish to simply test the code, they can run : 
```./a.out```
To execute the included Windows 64-bit executable.

An example of generated text :

Enjoy!
